# Captain Redbeard's Adventure

A 2D classic-lego-pirate-themed platformer, heavily inspired by the 2D LEGO® platformers of the mid-2010s and the 1989-1997 LEGO® Pirates theme.

I absolutely loooved the browser-based lego games of the 2010s, so I decided to create one of my own. I created this with no prior experience in godot (and it shows) but I hope you have fun playing this prototype of a game!
